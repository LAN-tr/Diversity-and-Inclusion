# Diversity + Inclusion

## Overview

### Purpose
This website's purpose is to introduce concepts around diversity and inclusion for the workplace or in an educational environment. The aim is to offer straightforward information and tips on how to implement practices which support a diverse community of people and help them feel included and valued. The idea is to present this information in a clear, organized format, creating a visually appealing, easy-to-navigate website. This should help the target audience quickly access the information that they need.  


### Target Audience
The target audience for this project are people working in the education sector or employers and workplace managers. At first I was thinking about including other user groups in my planning such as people in education, parents and carers of people in education, people seeking employment and people in employment. However the original brief seemed to suggest a narrower focus of presenting basic guidance and information specific to helping to outline what is best practice within educational or workplace environments. 

I have tried to think about what various different users working within either different educational age-groups or various workplaces would want information about. This is reflected in the user stories below. Some of the things that came up when I was working on the user stories are the number of specific things people could be looking for and the need to balance general advice with more focussed help. I have decided to set up a More Information area with links in both the Education and Employment sections whilst maintaining providing a general overview of diversity and inclusion practices in the main body of each section.

### Update

I didn't set up the More Information sections and I pared back the content I was going to include quite considerably. It was just too much text and trying to be too many things at once. I focussed instead on the original brief to provide a basic understanding of diversity and inclusion. I will comment more about changing the content once I had started building the site in the Challenges and Final Thoughts section. Obviously it is not the best approach.

## User Stories

Education Section:
- **User Story 1:** As an early years teacher I want to help provide an inclusive environment and find out about play-based learning within this field. 

  **Acceptance Criteria:** Have appropriate age-range guidance and specific link(s) to lesson plans and/or resources for play-based learning to help with diversity and inclusion.

- **User Story 2:** As a primary school teacher I would like to find out about teaching practices that cater to diverse cultural,social and learning needs and that recognize different learning styles and foster respect.

  **Acceptance Criteria:** Age-appropriate advice, general tips for catering to diverse needs, specific links for different learning styles information.

- **User Story 3:** As a secondary school teacher I would like to address any bullying as a result of perceived difference. I'm looking for advice about promoting a safe environment for all the students.

  **Acceptance Criteria:** Guidance on trying to avoid bullying through fostering an inclusive environment, links for more specific advice for dealing with existing bullying and ways to create a welcoming, safe space for all students.

 - **User Story 4:** As a tutor in further education I am looking to create an initiative to increase participation from underrepresented groups.

    **Acceptance Criteria:** General core principles advice for an overall view and then include specific links in the more infomation section.

## Update

I think the above user stories were too specific for the brief, I initially tried putting in two sections one for advice for educators and one advice for employers, and then trying to cover different age groups and different workplaces in those respective sections but it both seemed to provide too much information and not enough and fall between two stools really. I went back to the brief and simplified my content and the two sections became one titled Diversity and one titled Inclusivity. I think this reflects my lack of familiarity with the user stories approach and I should have pared this all back at the design stage.

The goals we were given for the assignment were:

External User’s Goal:
The user wants to gain a basic understanding of diversity and inclusion in the workplace or educational environment. They seek straightforward information and tips presented in a clear, organised format.

Site Owner’s Goal:
The site owner aims to create a visually appealing, easy-to-navigate webpage that introduces diversity and inclusion concepts and offers basic guidance on how to implement these practices. The focus is on clear communication through effective use of HTML and CSS.

These were the two sets of needs I focussed on in the end.



## Design Decisions

### Wireframes

![wireframe image of website design for tablet screens](image-1.png)

![wireframe image of website design for desktop screens](image-2.png)

  
This is going to be a responsive, mobile first development, as the majority of internet traffic comes from mobile phones but the site will also make the most of larger screen sizes. This is a one page layout with a main navigation menu and structured content. I am using colour contrast and alt-text for non-text elements to make the site more accessible. I am introducing the topic of diversity and inclusivity with an image at the top and a message about what the content can provide. The content is organized into clear sections with headings and paragraphs that outline the key priciples of diversity and inclusion. I am providing a simple list of tips and best practices to help users understand how to promote diversity. I have used the Roboto font from Google Fonts as a base font and the Lato font as a title font. The colours I am using are: #3a3a3a for the text and styling the icons in the footer and also for my box shadow. The background is white (#ffffff#) and the h1 text is #252525. The cover text box is rgba (241, 109, 107, .7) the .7 makes it lightly transparent, the colour complements the sky image and adds a splash of colour to the hero image.

**Update** 

The design changed from my wireframes as I decided to change the content, cover text, and section headings. The cover text changed from 'Your resource for inclusive change' to 'Impower. Include. Thrive.' The 'We are here to help' section became 'Encouraging equality, diversity and inclusion brings numerous benefits'. The two sections became 'Diversity' and 'Inclusion'.

### Accessibility Considerations
 
I used colour contrasting text and backgrounds and I added alt text for my font awesome icons. I followed guidance about the background images and decorative images that I shouldn't add alt text for these as if they were pure decoration the alt text could confuse or clutter the screen reader experience. I added hidden headings though to any sections that didn't have them, this was picked up by the validator.
